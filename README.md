# CLI_Constructor_Hangman

## What Problem Does the App Solve
This app is an intro to command line interface with Node.js. It introduces me to a way to interact with a server via Node.js. This program also taught me about javascript constructors and how to make files dependent on other files.

## App Overiew
The app is organized by functions. There is one function that is run and it will call other functions.

## How to Use the App
1. **You must have Node.js installed for this to work, this is a prequisite**
1. Open up your command line interface (i.e. terminal on Mac or command prompt on Windows)
2. Navigate to the folder where the program is located
3. Verify required files are present
    1. You should already have the `package.json` file; if you don't, run `npm init -y`. 
    2. Now, make sure to run `npm install` which will install the proper dependencies in this folder.
4. Run the node program by entering `node index.js`.
5. Voila, you've used the app. It should print the response to the console (command prompt).
